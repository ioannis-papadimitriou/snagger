This is an attempt to predict the S&P500 by using its own historical data (singlevariate), as well as using the aforementioned past 
data in conjuction with other indices and macroeconomic indicators (multivariate).
- The prices were predicted up to 30 days ahead.
- The multivariate model was used for single and multiple predictions ahead.
- The correlation of index prices and macroeconomic indicators was investigated.
- Although the results are not optimal, they are in the right direction, and would certainly become better with more data.
