# TF- ObjDet
Empty parking spot detection using Tensorflow + YOLO. 

-Trained the model with a small dataset I created manually using google images and LabelIMG. 
-Trained it with generic hyperparameters, loss was high, but the result was decent.
-Used the tiny_YOLOv3.
-Ran in Colab.

TODO:
-Enlarge and diversify the dataset.
-Tweak hyperparameters and run it for longer.
