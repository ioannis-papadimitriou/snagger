# TF- ObjDet
Empty parking spot detection using Tensorflow + ssd_inception_v2_coco. 

-Trained the model with a small dataset I created manually using google images and LabelIMG. 
-Didn't go through all the way as I couldn't run it with TF-2.x (so bye bye Colab), and had to create a local env with TF-1.6 and post process using TF-2.0.
-The main goal was to learn how to do it with Tensorflow Object Detection API. Will revisit after the API is suitable for TF-2.x.
